		My name is Muhaj Mahmood and I am a freshman at UMass Boston University.<br>
		I decided to major in Computer Science to learn more about the world of coding<br>
		and develop skills that are very much needed in today's world.<br>
		As my first semester of college comes to an end, I have already gotten a general<br>
		idea of what is involved in this major.<br>
		Although it is not easy, there's a lot of use for it in many different fields.<br>
		</div>
		<h4>Things that I learned so far:</h4>
		<ul style="list-style-type:disc">

			<li>Html</li>
			<li>History of Computer Science</li>
			<li>The use of Computer Science in many different kinds of fields</li>
